      <p>
        I'm looking to start a new career path and will be earning a degree in
        Web and Computer Programing. I was previously in a career in
        hospitality, so this is new to me. Though I did edit my old Myspace
        using HTML and CSS way back when, maybe that experience will help?
      </p>

        I would like to learn a skill I can work at remotely, according to my
        own schedule. Plus, the ability to create websites would couple nicely
        with my training in Graphic Design from a previously earned associates.
        I have always enjoyed art and being creative, learning this will allow
        me to take my hobby to a new level.

        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        all my life, but I am glad to have found my way back to Church after
        some rocky missteps in my youth. I enjoy the teachings of Alma the
        younger, someone else who made some errors at a young age and found his
        way back. Some good advice I start my day with, Alma 7:24 "And see that
        ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good
        works." These instructions keep me moving forward.
